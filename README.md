# 🥽 Catch the Sticks XR

An interactive WebXR experience inspired by the classic arcade reflex game where sticks fall randomly and you must catch them before they hit the ground.

This project was built as a personal learning challenge to explore modern 3D web technologies and experiment with immersive, browser-based XR development.

## 🎮 Gameplay Concept

- Simulates a 3D stick-dropping arcade machine in a virtual space
- Sticks fall from random positions at random intervals
- Player must "grab" them before they hit the ground (via mouse, touch, or VR controller)
- Scoring is based on speed and precision – great for reflex training
